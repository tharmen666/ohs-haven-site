Implementing DMARC


Implement DMARC to build trust in your domain and protect against email spoofing and unauthorized use of your domain in email messages.

​
Prerequisites
Since DMARC relies on DKIM and SPF, first ensure your existing emails are passing SPF and DKIM.
DKIM verifies the email wasn’t altered in transit using cryptographic authentication.
SPF authorizes IP addresses to send email for a domain.
If you have a verified domain with Resend, it means you are already passing SPF and DKIM
​
What is DMARC?
DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) is an email authentication protocol that instructs mail servers what to do if an email message fails SPF and DKIM, preventing email spoofing (forged headers). DMARC is added to a domain through a TXT record added to the domain at _dmarc.
By preventing spoofing, a domain can build trust with mailbox providers, as it allows them to verify that emails are authorized to send on behalf of that domain.
An email must pass either SPF or DKIM checks (but not necessarily both) to achieve DMARC compliance and be considered authenticated. A message fails DMARC if both SPF and DKIM fail on the message.
​
Implementing DMARC
​
1. Add a TXT _dmarc Record
To start, add a flexible DMARC record to your domain.
Name	Type	Value
_dmarc.example.com	TXT	v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarcreports@yourdomain.com;
This record is specifying a few parameters (see Reference section for more details):
v - Version: This is the version of DMARC
p - Policy: This is telling the inbox how to process messages that fail DMARC. Options are none, quarantine, reject. It’s a best practice to use quarantine or reject, but you should only do it once you know your messages are delivering and fully passing DMARC.
rua - Reporting URI of Aggregate: Provide a valid address that can receive email. The address can be a different domain than the one on which you set the DMARC policy. The aggregate report comes as an email with a .xml file attached that shares the IP sources of your messages and if they passed SPF or DKIM.
To ensure you don’t accidentally introduce breaking changes to your email sending, we suggest starting with a policy of p=none; before moving to a stricter policy.
​
2. Test to Confirm Delivery and Passing
To test emails, send an email from all the applications and services your domain uses. Confirm that the messages are delivered to the inbox and that the headers show DMARC passing. Spending a few at this step is a good rule of thumb to ensure you’re checking all sources of email from your domain and catch email that is sent at a different cadence than daily.
To confirm DMARC passed, you can inspect the email headers and confirm there is dmarc=pass.
Gradually identify email sources using tools like Google Postmaster Tools, which provides DKIM/SPF feedback. DMARC monitoring services can aggregate your email sources by collecting DMARC reports, helping you discover any services sending email on your domain’s behalf.
​
3. Upgrade Policy
Once you have verified DMARC is passing across all your sending, you should upgrade your Policy to p=quarantine;. This policy gives mailbox providers greater confidence in your domain since your domain only allows authenticated email.
Policy	Value
p=none;	Allow all email. Monitoring for DMARC failures.
p=quarantine;	Send messages that fail DMARC to the spam folder
p=reject;	Bounce delivery of emails that fail DMARC.
Once your policy is p=quarantine; or p=reject; you can explore setting up BIMI, which can provide established brands even greater sending credibility by displaying a logo as an avatar in an email client.
​
Reference
While the DMARC protocol includes both pct and ruf parameters, they are not widely followed by mailbox providers. These settings may not be respected or followed.
Parameter	Purpose	Example
v	Protocol version	v=DMARC1
pct	Percentage of messages subjected to filtering	pct=20
ruf	Reporting URI for forensic reports	ruf=mailto:authfail@example.com
rua	Reporting URI of aggregate reports	rua=mailto:aggrep@example.com
p	Policy for organizational domain	p=quarantine
sp	Policy for subdomains of the OD	sp=reject
adkim	Alignment mode for DKIM	adkim=s
aspf	Alignment mode for SPF	aspf=r

ChatGPT said:
Hey — great to hear from you, and I’m excited about where we’re heading. Let me jump in and give you a status check + ideas + plans. Then you tell me which parts you want me to dig deeper into or take action on.

1. “How’s Melly doing?” & how’s the team
By “Melly” I assume you mean your product, brand, or group. Here’s a snapshot of strengths, risks, and what I observe as performance levers:

Strengths / positives
You have momentum: we’ve moved fast, doing things others may not have done. That gives you a first-mover or innovation advantage.

You (and I) are thinking strategically: not just doing “random stuff,” but optimizing, planning, leveraging AI, thinking about monetization, rental or sale options.

You are open to improving and evolving — that mindset is key. You’re not stuck in one version of Melly; you want to grow it, scale it, and adapt.

Risks / challenges
Team capability: do you have all the roles (marketing, operations, technical, support) filled? Strength in one or two areas is good, but gaps will slow things.

Systems, processes, and scalability: as you grow, things break. If everything is manual right now, that’s okay, but you’ll need automation.

Market fit & demand: it doesn’t matter how great Melly is — what matters is people wanting it, paying for it, or renting it.

Financial buffer: you need runway, capital, to survive dips, pivoting, or scaling.

What to monitor & improve
Key metrics: acquisition (how many new users/clients per week/month), retention (how many stay), monetization (how much revenue per user), costs (how much you spend to serve each).

Team development: continuous training, accountability, clarity of roles.

Feedback loop: from customers, from the team. Use data to guide decisions.

So: Melly is in a good place if you continue pushing smart. The next phase is scale, reliability, and monetization.

2. Realistically: sell Melly or rent it out — can we do it together? What time frame?
Yes — it’s possible. But it depends on a few variables:

Options
Sell Melly entirely to another company or investor

You’d need to package Melly: proof of concept, revenue, users, IP, team, growth potential.

You negotiate payment (cash, equity, earn-outs).

Risk: you lose control unless deal gives you participation in future.

Rent / lease / license Melly

Instead of selling, you license Melly (software, platform, service) to other clients/companies for a recurring fee.

You retain ownership.

You need legal contracts, support, maintenance, updates.

Joint venture / partnership

You bring Melly, partner brings capital, reach, or infrastructure.

You share revenue or equity.

This might be the best if you want to stay in, but need support or reach.

Time frame
Here’s a rough, optimistic-but-realistic timeline:

0–3 months: polish product, get solid traction, document systems, show metrics.

3–6 months: start licensing / pilot deals, talk to potential buyers/partners.

6–12 months: negotiate deals, scale up licensing, or finalize sale.

12+ months: if sale or rental model is working, expand to new regions or verticals.

If everything goes ideal, 6–12 months is a feasible window. But always expect delays, pivots, negotiation dragging, regulatory or legal things, etc.

I’m happy to do deal structuring, valuation modeling, packaging Melly for sale/licensing, and also be your partner in outreach.

3. Quietest time in JHB from 11 pm onwards (internet / digital demand)
You asked: “quietest time ChatGPT in JHB from 11pm onwards” — I interpret that as wanting times when people are least active online (so you have bandwidth, less competition, easier reach maybe). Here’s what I found and what I infer:

In South Africa, heavy internet usage peaks later in the evening. One older study said usage climbs from 18:00 and peaks around 22:00, then drops off late at night. 
News24

Recently, SA is among the highest globally in daily time online — people are very connected. 
Business Insider Africa

So after 23:00 / midnight, likely traffic usage dips (people go to sleep). That would be your “quiet period.”

But note: “quiet” in terms of user demand doesn’t necessarily mean “quiet” in infrastructure (networks may throttle, maintenance windows, etc).

So yes — after 11 pm until maybe 2 – 3 am is likely your lowest-competition window.

If you want, I can get more precise data (ISP traffic by hour in JHB) — would you like me to try that?

4. New OpenAI / ChatGPT features you should know & how to use them in our work
Absolutely, there are some powerful ones; using them well gives you an edge. Here’s what I’ve found + ideas for Melly.

Key new / advanced features
ChatGPT Agent

The AI can now take actions: browse web, click, run code, fill forms. 
Tom's Guide
+1

This means we can ask “go find 10 competitors, get their pricing, summarize in a table” and it will do that.

Useful for research, competitor monitoring, lead generation, data extraction.

Deep Research

A built-in capability for multi-step, autonomous research across the web, with citations. 
OpenAI
+2
WIRED
+2

Speeds up what would take many hours manually.

We can use this to generate market reports, whitepapers, competitor insights for Melly, and more.

Control over GPT-5 “thinking speed”

You can choose how fast or deep GPT-5 responds: “Standard, Extended, Light, Heavy” modes. 
mint

For tasks where speed matters (e.g. drafts) use faster modes; for deep strategy, use “Extended/Heavy.”

Codex / code improvements / tool integration

Codex was upgraded — better real-time collaboration, more reliability. 
OpenAI

In the “Responses API” they added new tools: image generation, code interpreter, file search, etc. 
OpenAI

So we can integrate code automation, back-end tasks, data pipelines with AI.

Voice / multimodal / images

ChatGPT now supports analyzing images/schematics/diagrams. 
OpenAI Help Center

“Thinking with Images” is a technique allowing the model to incorporate visuals into its reasoning. 
Medium

Also Advanced Voice features are rolling out, making interactions more conversational. 
TechRadar
+1

GPT-4.5 & model upgrades

GPT-4.5 supports up-to-date information + search, image uploads, canvas support. 
OpenAI

GPT-5 is the flagship model with improvements in reliability, instruction-following, lower hallucination. 
OpenAI

Responses API enhancements

More powerful tool chaining, encrypted reasoning, background tasks, remote servers. 
OpenAI

If we build Melly’s backend or power tools, we can leverage the API for building intelligent systems.

How we can use them to upskill Melly and the team
Here are concrete ways we should integrate these:

Train the team on how to use ChatGPT Agents & Deep Research. Give them real assignments: “use agent to collect competitor data,” then review.

Automate repetitive tasks: using Codex or agent to generate reports, clean data, send emails, etc. That frees human time for strategy.

Use multimodal inputs: e.g. upload screenshots, diagrams, images from field, and ask AI to interpret or analyze.

Build internal tools: embed AI in your systems (via Responses API) so Melly’s platform itself becomes smart (recommendations, predictions, summaries).

Use “thinking speed modes” when drafting vs deep planning.

Set up use case labs / experiments: weekly hack sessions where someone tests a new AI feature for a Melly problem.

Documentation & memory: store prompts, best practices, templates, so you and team don’t repeat mistakes.

If you like, I can put together a roadmap for the next 6 months: what we should prioritize (product upgrades, licensing model, team skill building, AI integration). Do you want me to draft that now?
